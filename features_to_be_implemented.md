# Make a web app 
1) use chatbot-ui
2) have a side panel similar to
   <img width="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a280a996-8238-432b-b001-09f8d0dbe693" />
  with side-panel

3) Has a page to manage a knowledge base, which allows
   a) upload files
   b) list current files in the knowledge base
   c) has buttons to let user delete/update files in the knowledge base
   etc.
